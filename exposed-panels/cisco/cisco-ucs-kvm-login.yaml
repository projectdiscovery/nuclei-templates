  description: The KVM console is an interface accessible from the Cisco UCS Manager GUI or the KVM Launch Manager that emulates a direct KVM connection. Unlike the KVM dongle, which requires you to be physically connected to the server, the KVM console allows you to connect to the server from a remote location across the network.
