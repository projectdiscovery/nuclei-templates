  name: SSH Key-Based Authentication - Disabled
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: unknown
  description: |
    SSH key-based authentication is disabled, allowing password-based logins, which increases the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
  remediation: |
    Enable SSH key-based authentication by adding the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and disabling password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (PasswordAuthentication no).
