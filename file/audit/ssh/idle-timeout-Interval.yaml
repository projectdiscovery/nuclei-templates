  name: Set SSH Idle Timeout Interval
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: unknown
  description: |
    Missing an SSH idle timeout interval can lead to security risks by allowing unattended sessions to remain open, increasing the chance of unauthorized access or session hijacking.
  remediation: |
    Set ClientAliveInterval 300 and ClientAliveCountMax 0 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enforce an idle timeout and restart the SSH service.
