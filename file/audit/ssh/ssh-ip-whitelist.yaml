  name: Unrestricted SSH Access from Non-Whitelisted IPs
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: unknown
  description: |
    SSH access is not restricted to specific IP addresses, allowing connections from any source. This increases the risk of unauthorized access and brute-force attacks.
  remediation: |
    Restrict SSH to specific IPs in /etc/ssh/sshd_config by setting ListenAddress <trusted-IP> and restarting the SSH service.
