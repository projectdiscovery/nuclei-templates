id: CVE-2022-34265

info:
  name: Django - SQL injection
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. The Trunc() and Extract() database functions are subject to SQL injection if untrusted data is used as a kind/lookup_name value. Applications that constrain the lookup name and kind choice to a known safe list are unaffected.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Django to version 3.2.14 or 4.0.6 or later that properly sanitizes kind/lookup_name values in Trunc() and Extract() database functions.
  impact: |
    Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
