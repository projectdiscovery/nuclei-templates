  name: elFinder 2.1.58 - Remote Code Execution
  author: idealphase
  severity: critical
  description: elFinder 2.1.58 is vulnerable to remote code execution. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands on the server hosting the elFinder PHP connector, even with minimal configuration.
  remediation: The issues were patched in version 2.1.59. As a workaround, ensure the connector is not exposed without authentication.
