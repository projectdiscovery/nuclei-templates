## CVE-2018-8298: ChakraCore - Remote Code Execution (Type Confusion)

### Description

ChakraCore (the JavaScript engine for Microsoft Edge) contains a remote code execution vulnerability caused by memory corruption in object handling. Specifically, the `InitializeNumberFormat` and `InitializeDateTimeFormat` functions in `Intl.js` do not check if an object has already been initialized. This allows an attacker to initialize the same object multiple times, leading to type confusion and arbitrary code execution.

This template targets the server-side attack surface (e.g., Node-ChakraCore) by evaluating a JavaScript payload that triggers the underlying flaw.

### Template Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CVE ID | CVE-2018-8298 |
| Severity | High (CVSS 7.5) |
| Type | Full POC (Behavioral) |
| KEV | Yes |

### Changes

- Added `http/cves/2018/CVE-2018-8298.yaml` - Nuclei template with behavioral POC
- Added `vulnerable-env/CVE-2018-8298/` - Docker environment (Node-ChakraCore) for validation

### Template Features

1. Uses a behavioral JS payload to trigger `Intl` double-initialization.
2. Identifies the vulnerability by checking if the engine allows re-initialization (which it shouldn't).
3. Provides reliable detection without requiring external OAST callbacks (though it can be used for RCE verification).

### Testing Instructions

```bash
# Build and run vulnerable container
cd vulnerable-env/CVE-2018-8298
docker build -t cve-2018-8298 .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name cve-2018-8298 cve-2018-8298

# Run template with debug
nuclei -t http/cves/2018/CVE-2018-8298.yaml -u http://localhost:8080 -debug

# Cleanup
docker stop cve-2018-8298 && docker rm cve-2018-8298
```

### Validation Result

```
[CVE-2018-8298] [http] [high] http://localhost:8080/eval
{
  "result": "vulnerable"
}
```
