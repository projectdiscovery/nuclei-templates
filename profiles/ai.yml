# Nuclei Configuration Profile for AI Security Testing
#
# With the rapid adoption of AI and LLM technologies across industries, securing AI infrastructure
# has become critical. Organizations are deploying AI models, vector databases, ML platforms, and
# LLM applications at an unprecedented pace, often without proper security assessments.
#
# Purpose:
# This profile enables comprehensive security testing of AI ecosystems, covering:
# - LLM Application Security: Prompt injection, jailbreaks, data exfiltration, code execution
# - AI Infrastructure: Jupyter notebooks, MLflow, Kubeflow, TensorBoard, model serving platforms
# - Vector Databases: Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant exposures and misconfigurations
# - ML Platforms: Databricks, H2O.ai, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI misconfiguration
# - AI Services: OpenAI, HuggingFace, Anthropic API key leaks and unauthorized access
# - Model Serving: TorchServe, Triton, BentoML, Gradio vulnerabilities
# - AI Development Tools: Streamlit, Ollama, PrivateGPT, MCP servers
