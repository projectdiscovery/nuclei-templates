  name: DNS Zone Transfer - Configuration Check
  author: songyaeji
  severity: high
  description: >
    If DNS Zone Transfer is allowed to all hosts, it may expose sensitive information such as hostnames,
    network structure, and system data. This template checks whether the BIND DNS server restricts
    zone transfers via allow-transfer directive in /etc/named.conf.
