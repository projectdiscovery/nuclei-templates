info:
  name: /etc/hosts File Owner and Permission Check
  author: songyaeji
  severity: high
  description: >
    If the /etc/hosts file is writable by non-root users, attackers may register malicious DNS mappings and redirect legitimate domains to malicious sites (pharming attacks). This check ensures /etc/hosts is owned by root and has appropriate permissions.
