  name: DoS Vulnerable Services Disabled (echo, discard, daytime, chargen)
  author: songyaeji
  severity: high
  description: >
    If services such as echo, discard, daytime, and chargen are enabled on the system, 
    attackers may exploit them to extract system information or launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
    These legacy services should be disabled if not explicitly required.
