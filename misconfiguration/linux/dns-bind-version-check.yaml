  description: >
    Older versions of the BIND DNS server may contain vulnerabilities such as Service Denial Attacks,
    Buffer Overflows, and remote code execution risks. This template checks if the BIND service (named) is running
    and retrieves its version to determine whether security patches have been applied.
