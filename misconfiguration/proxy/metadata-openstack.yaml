# This attack abuses a misconfigured proxy that allows access to the metadata
# IP or a name which resolves to the IP. A standard proxy request is made to
# the proxy using the full metadata URL, which the proxy will fulfill to its
# own metadata service.

# The proxy may also be vulnerable to host/port enumeration on localhost or
# inside the private network.
