    If introspection is disabled on your target, Field Suggestion can allow users to still earn information on the GraphQL schema.
    By default, GraphQL backends have a feature for fields and operations suggestions.
    If you try to query a field but you have made a typo, GraphQL will attempt to suggest fields that are similar to the initial attempt.
