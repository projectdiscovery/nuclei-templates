info:
  name: HTML2WP <= 1.0.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: theamanrawat
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The HTML2WP WordPress plugin through 1.0.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when importing files, and does not validate them, as a result, unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files (such as PHP) on the remote server.
