id: CVE-2019-10092

info:
  name: Apache mod_proxy HTML Injection / Partial XSS
  author: pdteam
  severity: medium
  description: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.
