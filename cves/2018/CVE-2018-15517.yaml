id: CVE-2018-15517

info:
  name: D-LINK Central WifiManager Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: "D-LINK Central WifiManager is susceptible to server-side request forgery. The MailConnect feature on D-Link Central WiFiManager CWM-100 1.03 r0098 devices is intended to check a connection to an SMTP server but actually allows outbound TCP to any port on any IP address, as demonstrated by an index.php/System/MailConnect/host/127.0.0.1/port/22/secure/ URI. This can undermine accountability of where scan or connections actually came from and or bypass the FW etc. This can be automated via script or using a browser."
