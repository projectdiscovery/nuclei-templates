  description: WordPress AccessAlly plugin before 3.5.7 allows sensitive information leakage because the file \"resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php\" (which is responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode) dumps serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, and no login or administrator role is required.
