info:
  name: Impacket directory traversal
  author: geeknik
  description: Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist in smbserver.py in Impacket through 0.9.22. An attacker that connects to a running smbserver instance can list and write to arbitrary files via ../ directory traversal. This could potentially be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution by replacing /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized key.
