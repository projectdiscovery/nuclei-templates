info:
  name: Sunhillo SureLine - Unauthenticated OS Command Injection
  description: The /cgi/networkDiag.cgi script directly incorporated user-controllable parameters within a shell command, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resulting command by injecting valid OS command input. The following POST request injects a new command that instructs the server to establish a reverse TCP connection to another system, allowing the establishment of an interactive remote shell session.
