id: CVE-2021-32618

info:
  name: Flask Open Redirect
  author: 0x_Akoko
  severity: medium
  description: There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit
    library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\github.com
    will pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://interact.sh.
