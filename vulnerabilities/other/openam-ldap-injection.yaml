  name: LDAP Injection In OPENAM
  author: xelkomy
  severity: high
  description: The vulnerability was found in the password reset feature that OpenAM provides. When a user tries to reset his password, he is asked to enter his username then the backend validates whether the user exists or not through an LDAP query before the password reset token is sent to the user’s email.
