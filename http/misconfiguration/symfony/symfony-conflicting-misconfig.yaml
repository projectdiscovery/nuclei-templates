  severity: medium
  description: |
    A misconfiguration in Symfonyâ€™s trusted proxy and header settings could trigger a ConflictingHeadersException when both Forwarded and X-Forwarded-* headers were present. When debug mode was enabled in production, this issue could have exposed sensitive environment details such as SMTP credentials, application paths, or system configuration.
