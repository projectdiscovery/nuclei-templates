# This attack abuses a misconfigured proxy that allows access to the metadata
# IP or a name which resolves to the IP. A standard proxy request is made to
# the proxy using the full metadata URL, which the proxy will fulfill to its
# own metadata service.
# The proxy may also be vulnerable to host/port enumeration on localhost or
# inside the private network.

  name: Openstack Metadata Service Check
  author: sullo
  severity: critical
  description: The Openstack host is configured as a proxy which allows access to the instance metadata service. This could allow significant access to the host/infrastructure.
  remediation: Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible.
