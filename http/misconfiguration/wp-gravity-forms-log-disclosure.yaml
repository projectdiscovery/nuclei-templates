    The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress stores log files that may be accessible without authentication. When logging is enabled, debug and error logs are created in the wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/logs/ directory. These logs can contain sensitive information including form submission data, file paths, database queries, PHP errors, API keys, and user information.
