  name: HTML SRC unclaimed domain detection
  author: matejsmycka
  severity: moderate
  description: |
    Detected src attribute pointing to unclaimed domain.
    It is misconfiguration even if the domain cannot be claimed by attacker, e.g. unclaimed.claimed-domain.com
  impact: |
    If an attacker can claim the unclaimed domain, they can serve malicious content to users of
    the main site, potentially leading to defacement, data theft, or further exploitation.
