id: CVE-2008-2650

info:
  name: CMSimple 3.1 - Local File Inclusion
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: medium
  description: |
    CMSimple 3.1 is susceptible to local file inclusion via cmsimple/cms.php when register_globals is enabled which allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl parameter to index.php. NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file execution by including adm.php and then invoking the upload action. NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without changing the version number.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the entire system.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade CMSimple to a patched version or apply the necessary security patches provided by the vendor.
