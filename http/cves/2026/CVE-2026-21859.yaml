id: CVE-2026-21859

info:
  name: Mailpit < 1.28.3 - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: omarkurt
  severity: high
  description: |
    Mailpit versions before 1.28.3 contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /proxy endpoint. The endpoint allows requests to internal network resources without proper validation of destination IP addresses, enabling attackers to access internal services,cloud metadata endpoints, and other protected resources.
  impact: |
    An attacker can probe internal services, access cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure),read captured emails via internal API, and perform lateral movement within the network.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Mailpit to version 1.28.3 or later which implements IP address validation to block internal network access via the proxy endpoint.
