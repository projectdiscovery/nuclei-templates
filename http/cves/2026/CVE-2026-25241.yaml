info:
  name: PEAR pearweb < 1.33.0 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: bswearingen
  severity: critical
  description: |
    PEAR is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. Prior to version 1.33.0, an unauthenticated SQL injection in the /get/<package>/<version> endpoint allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL via a crafted package version. This issue has been patched in version 1.33.0.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to extract sensitive data from the database or potentially achieve remote code execution.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade PEAR pearweb to version 1.33.0 or later.
