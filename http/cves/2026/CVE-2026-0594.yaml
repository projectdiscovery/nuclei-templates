id: CVE-2026-0594

info:
  name: WordPress List Site Contributors - Reflected XSS
  author: m4sh_wacker
  severity: high
  description: |
    The List Site Contributors plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting 
    via the 'alpha' parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.1.8 due to insufficient input 
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to 
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user 
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
