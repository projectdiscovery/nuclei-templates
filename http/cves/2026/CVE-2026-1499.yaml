id: CVE-2026-1499

info:
  name: WordPress WP Duplicate <= 1.1.8 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: bswearingen
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The WP Duplicate plugin (slug local-sync) for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization leading to Arbitrary File Upload in all versions up to and including 1.1.8. This is due to a missing capability check on the process_add_site() AJAX action combined with path traversal in the file upload functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated (subscriber level) attackers to set the internal prod_key_random_id option, which can then be used by an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication checks and write arbitrary files to the server via the handle_upload_single_big_file() function.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the affected system.
  remediation: |
    Update the WP Duplicate plugin to a version newer than 1.1.8.
