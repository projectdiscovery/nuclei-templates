id: CVE-2024-47533

info:
  name: Cobbler 'XML-RPC' - Authentication Bypass
  author: songyaeji
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes. This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.
  impact: |
    Anyone with network access can connect to Cobbler XML-RPC with default credentials and make arbitrary changes, gaining full control.
  remediation: |
    Update Cobbler to version 3.2.3 or 3.3.7 or later.
