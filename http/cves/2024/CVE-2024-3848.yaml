id: CVE-2024-3848

info:
  name: Mlflow < 2.11.0 - Path Traversal
  author: gy741
  severity: high
  description: |
    A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0, identified as a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could be lead to disclose of sensitive information such as SSH Keys or Internal configurations.
  remediation: |
    To fix this vulnerability, it is important to update the mlflow package to the latest version 2.12.1.
