info:
  name: Devika - Local File Inclusion
  author: nechyo,nukunga,harksu,olfloralo,gy741
  severity: high
  description: |
    A local file read vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the 'snapshot_path' parameter in the '/api/get-browser-snapshot' endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a request with a malicious 'snapshot_path' parameter, leading to arbitrary file read from the system. This issue impacts the security of the application by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files and data.
  remediation: |
    Ensure input validation is implemented to prevent malicious file inclusions and use whitelists for allowed file paths.
