  name: Google for WooCommerce <= 2.8.6 - Information Disclosure via Publicly Accessible PHP Info File
  author: popcorn94
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Google for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.6. This is due to publicly accessible print_php_information.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information about Webserver and PHP configuration, which can be used to aid other attacks.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can access PHP configuration information including server details, installed extensions, and environment variables, which can aid in planning further attacks.
  remediation: |
    Update Google for WooCommerce plugin to version 2.8.7 or later.
