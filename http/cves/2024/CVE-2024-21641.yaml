id: CVE-2024-21641

info:
  name: Flarum < 1.8.5 - Open Redirect
  author: kking
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Flarum is open source discussion platform software. Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation.
  remediation: |
    The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe.
