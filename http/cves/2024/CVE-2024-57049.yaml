id: CVE-2024-57049

info:
  name: TP-Link Archer C20 - Authentication Bypass
  author: ritikchaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    A vulnerability in the TP-Link Archer C20 router with firmware version V6.6_230412 and earlier permits unauthorized individuals to bypass authentication on interfaces under the /cgi directory. When adding a Referer header with value "http://tplinkwifi.net" to requests, the router will recognize the request as passing authentication, allowing access to protected administration interfaces.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication by adding a specific Referer header, gaining unauthorized access to protected administration interfaces and router configuration.
  remediation: |
    Update TP-Link Archer C20 router to firmware version later than V6.6_230412 that addresses the authentication bypass vulnerability.
