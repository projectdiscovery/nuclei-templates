id: CVE-2024-10081

info:
  name: CodeChecker <= 6.24.1 - Authentication Bypass
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Authentication bypass occurs when the API URL ends with Authentication, Configuration or ServerInfo. This bypass allows superuser access to all API endpoints other than Authentication. These endpoints include the ability to add, edit, and remove products, among others.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication by crafting API URLs ending with specific keywords, gaining superuser access to all API endpoints including product management and configuration.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade CodeChecker to version 6.24.2 or later.
