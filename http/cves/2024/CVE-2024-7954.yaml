id: CVE-2024-7954

info:
  name: SPIP Porte Plume Plugin - Remote Code Execution
  author: s4e-io
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The porte_plume plugin used by SPIP before 4.30-alpha2, 4.2.13, and 4.1.16 is vulnerable to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary PHP as the SPIP user by sending a crafted HTTP request.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code as the SPIP user, achieving complete server compromise and full control of the SPIP installation and its data.
  remediation: |
    Update SPIP to version 4.3.0-alpha2, 4.2.13, or 4.1.16 or later to address the remote code execution vulnerability in the porte_plume plugin.
