id: CVE-2024-3234

info:
  name: Chuanhu Chat - Directory Traversal
  author: DhiyaneshDk
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to its use of an outdated gradio component. The application is designed to restrict user access to resources within the `web_assets` folder. However, the outdated version of gradio it employs is susceptible to path traversal, as identified in CVE-2023-51449. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended restrictions and access sensitive files, such as `config.json`, which contains API keys. The issue affects the latest version of chuanhuchatgpt prior to the fixed version released on 20240305.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can exploit path traversal to access sensitive files including API keys in config.json.
  remediation: |
    Update chuanhuchatgpt to the fixed version released on 20240305 or later.
