info:
  name: Apache HTTPd Windows UNC - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: pdteam

  description: |
    SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTML hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests or content Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60 which fixes this issue.  Note- Existing configurations that access UNC paths will have to configure new directive "UNCList" to allow access during request processing.
  impact: |
    Attackers on Windows-based Apache HTTPd servers can exploit SSRF to potentially leak NTLM hashes to malicious servers, leading to credential theft and potential network compromise.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to Apache HTTPd version 2.4.60 or later and configure the UNCList directive for UNC path access.
