  name: WordPress Grow by Tradedoubler Plugin < 2.0.22 - Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion
  author: ritikchaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The Grow by Tradedoubler WordPress plugin through version 2.0.21 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion via the component parameter. This makes it possible for attackers to include and execute PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can exploit local file inclusion to read sensitive files like wp-config.php and potentially execute arbitrary PHP code.
