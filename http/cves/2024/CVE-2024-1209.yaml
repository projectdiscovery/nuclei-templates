  description: |
    The LearnDash LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.1 via direct file access due to insufficient protection of uploaded assignments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain those uploads.

    Unauthenticated attackers can access the LearnDash API to obtain uploaded student assignments and coursework that should be restricted to instructors and enrolled learners.
  remediation: Fixed in 4.10.2
