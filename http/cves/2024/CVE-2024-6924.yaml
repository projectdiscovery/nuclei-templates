id: CVE-2024-6924

info:
  name: TrueBooker <= 1.0.2 - SQL Injection
  author: s4e-io
  severity: high
  description: |
    The TrueBooker Appointment Booking and Scheduler Plugin. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can exploit SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, email addresses, and other personal data.
  remediation: |
    Update TrueBooker Appointment Booking plugin to a version later than 1.0.2 to address the SQL injection vulnerability.
