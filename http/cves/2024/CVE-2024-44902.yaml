id: CVE-2024-44902

info:
  name: ThinkPHP 6.1.3-8.0.4 - Insecure Deserialization RCE
  author: KrE80r
  severity: critical
  description: |
    A deserialization vulnerability in ThinkPHP versions 6.1.3 to 8.0.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code when the Memcached PHP extension is installed.
    The vulnerability exploits a gadget chain through ThinkPHP's internal classes (ResourceRegister → DbManager → Memcached → Pivot → Model) where the Model destructor processes withAttr callbacks during deserialization, enabling code execution via system() calls.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially leading to full system compromise.
  remediation: Upgrade to ThinkPHP version 8.0.5 or later.
