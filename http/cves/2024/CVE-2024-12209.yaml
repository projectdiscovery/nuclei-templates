id: CVE-2024-12209

info:
  name: WP Umbrella Update Backup Restore & Monitoring <= 2.17.0 - Local File Inclusion
  author: s4e-io
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The WP Umbrella: Update Backup Restore & Monitoring plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.17.0 via the 'filename' parameter of the 'umbrella-restore' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
  remediation: |
    Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent directory traversal. Use a whitelist approach for file paths and restrict file access to intended directories only.
