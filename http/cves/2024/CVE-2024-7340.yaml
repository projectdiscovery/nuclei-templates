id: CVE-2024-7340

info:
  name: W&B Weave Server - Remote Arbitrary File Leak
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: high
  description: |
    The Weave server API allows remote users to fetch files from a specific directory, but due to a lack of input validation, it is possible to traverse and leak arbitrary files remotely. In various common scenarios, this allows a low-privileged user to assume the role of the server admin.
  impact: |
    Authenticated low-privileged attackers can exploit path traversal to read arbitrary files from the server, potentially accessing sensitive configuration files and credentials to escalate privileges to admin level.
  remediation: |
    Update W&B Weave Server to a version that includes the fix from pull request #1657 addressing the path traversal vulnerability.
