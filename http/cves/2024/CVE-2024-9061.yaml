info:
  name: WP Popup Builder Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation <= 1.3.5 - Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: s4e-io
  severity: high
  description: |
    The The WP Popup Builder Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary shortcodes through the AJAX action, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or remote code execution depending on available shortcodes in the WordPress installation.
  remediation: |
    Update WP Popup Builder plugin to a version later than 1.3.5 that properly validates values before executing do_shortcode in the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX action.
