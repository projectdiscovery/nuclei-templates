id: CVE-2024-6159

info:
  name: Push Notification for Post and BuddyPress <= 1.93 - SQL Injection
  author: s4e-io
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Push Notification for Post and BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'onesignal_externalid' and 'onesignal_get_subscriptionoptions_id' paramters in all versions up to, and including, 1.93 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute SQL injection attacks to extract sensitive database information including user credentials, subscriber data, and configuration details.
  remediation: |
    Update Push Notification for Post and BuddyPress plugin to version 1.94 or later to address the SQL injection vulnerability.
