id: CVE-2024-29895

info:
  name: Cacti cmd_realtime.php - Command Injection
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. A command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119, the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from `$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` by default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP.
  impact: |
    Authenticated attackers can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the Cacti server.
  remediation: |
    Update Cacti to a version that patches the command injection vulnerability.
