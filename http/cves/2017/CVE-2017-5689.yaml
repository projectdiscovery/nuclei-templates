id: CVE-2017-5689

info:
  name: Intel Active Management - Authentication Bypass
  author: pdteam
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Intel Active Management platforms are susceptible to authentication bypass. A non-privileged network attacker can gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability. A non-privileged local attacker can provision manageability features, gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, and Intel Small Business Technology. The issue has been observed in versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for all three platforms. Versions before 6 and after 11.6 are not impacted.
  impact: |
    An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Intel Active Management firmware, potentially leading to unauthorized control of the affected system.
  remediation: |
    Update the Intel Active Management firmware to version 11.6.55, 11.7.55, 11.11.55, 11.0.25, 8.1.71, or 7.1.91 to mitigate the vulnerability.
