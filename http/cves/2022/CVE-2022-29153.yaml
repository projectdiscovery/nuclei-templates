id: CVE-2022-29153

info:
  name: HashiCorp Consul/Consul Enterprise - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: c-sh0
  severity: high
  description: |
    HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise up to 1.9.16, 1.10.9, and 1.11 are susceptible to server-side request forgery. When redirects are returned by HTTP health check endpoints, Consul follows these HTTP redirects by default. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.

    - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29153
  remediation: 1) HTTP + interval health check configuration provides a disable_redirects option to prohibit this behavior. 2) Fixed in 1.9.17, 1.10.10, and 1.11.5.
