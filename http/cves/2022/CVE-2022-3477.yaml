  author: melmathari
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address

    Unauthenticated attackers who know a user's email address can bypass authentication through the Facebook login feature to gain complete access to any user account including administrator accounts on WordPress sites using tagDiv Composer.
  remediation: Fixed in 3.5
