info:
  name: WordPress Shortcodes and Extra Features for Phlox <2.9.8 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: Akincibor
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Shortcodes and extra features plugin for the Phlox theme before 2.9.8 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the response. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Update to the latest version of the WordPress Shortcodes and Extra Features for Phlox plugin (2.9.8 or higher) to mitigate this vulnerability.
