id: CVE-2022-25356

info:
  name: Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway <=8.5.0 - XML Injection
  author: Akincibor
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway through 8.5.0 is susceptible to XML injection via SecurityGateway.dll?view=login. An attacker can inject an arbitrary XML argument by adding a new parameter in the HTTP request URL. As a result, the XML parser fails the validation process and discloses information such as protection used (2FA), admin email, and product registration keys.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious XML code, leading to various security risks such as information disclosure, privilege escalation.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Alt-n/MDaemon Security Gateway to version 8.5.1 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
