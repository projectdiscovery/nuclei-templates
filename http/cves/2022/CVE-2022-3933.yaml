id: CVE-2022-3933

info:
  name: WordPress Essential Real Estate <3.9.6 - Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting
  author: r3Y3r53
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Essential Real Estate plugin before 3.9.6 contains an authenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which can allow someone with a role as low as admin to inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and launch of other attacks.
  impact: |
    An authenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further attacks.
  remediation: Fixed in version 3.9.6.
