id: CVE-2022-0679

info:
  name: WordPress Narnoo Distributor <=2.5.1 - Local File Inclusion
  author: Veshraj
  severity: critical
  description: |
    WordPress Narnoo Distributor plugin 2.5.1 and prior is susceptible to local file inclusion. The plugin does not validate and sanitize the lib_path parameter before being passed into a call to require() via the narnoo_distributor_lib_request AJAX action, and the content of the file is displayed in the response as JSON data. This can also lead to a remote code execution vulnerability depending on system and configuration.
