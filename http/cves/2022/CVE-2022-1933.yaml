id: CVE-2022-1933

info:
  name: WordPress CDI <5.1.9 - Cross Site Scripting
  author: Akincibor
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress CDI plugin prior to 5.1.9 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the response of an AJAX action. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade WordPress to version 5.1.9 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
