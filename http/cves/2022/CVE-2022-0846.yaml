  name: SpeakOut Email Petitions < 2.14.15.1 - SQL Injection
  author: theamanrawat
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The SpeakOut! Email Petitions WordPress plugin before 2.14.15.1 does not sanitise and escape the id parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the dk_speakout_sendmail AJAX action, leading to an SQL Injection exploitable by unauthenticated users.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.
  remediation: Fixed in version 2.14.15.1
