id: CVE-2022-2462

info:
  name: WordPress Transposh <=1.0.8.1 - Information Disclosure
  author: dwisiswant0
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Transposh plugin through is susceptible to information disclosure via the AJAX action tp_history, which is intended to return data about who has translated a text given by the token parameter. However, the plugin also returns the user's login name as part of the user_login attribute.  If an anonymous user submits the translation, the user's IP address is returned. An attacker can leak the WordPress username of translators and potentially execute other unauthorized operations.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain sensitive information from the target system.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to the latest version of the WordPress Transposh plugin (>=1.0.8.2) to mitigate this vulnerability.
