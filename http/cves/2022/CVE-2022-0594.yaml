  name: WordPress Shareaholic <9.7.6 - Information Disclosure
  author: atomiczsec
  severity: medium
  description: WordPress Shareaholic plugin prior to 9.7.6 is susceptible to information disclosure. The plugin does not have proper authorization check in one of the AJAX actions, available to both unauthenticated (before 9.7.5) and authenticated (in 9.7.5) users, allowing them to possibly obtain sensitive information such as active plugins and different versions (PHP, cURL, WP, etc.).
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain sensitive information from the target system.
  remediation: |
    Update the Shareaholic plugin to version 9.7.6 or later to fix the information disclosure vulnerability.
