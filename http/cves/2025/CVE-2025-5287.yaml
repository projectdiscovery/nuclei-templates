id: CVE-2025-5287

info:
  name: Likes and Dislikes Plugin <= 1.0.0 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: CodeStuffBreakThings
  severity: high
  description: |
    The Likes and Dislikes Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'post' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  remediation: No known patch at this time. Consider removing or disabling the plugin until a patch is released.
