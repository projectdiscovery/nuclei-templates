info:
  name: React Server Components - Denial of Service
  author: DhiyaneshDk
  severity: high
  description: |
    React Server Components 19.0.0 to 19.2.1 including react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack contain an insecure deserialization vulnerability caused by unsafe payload deserialization in Server Function endpoints, letting unauthenticated attackers cause denial of service by hanging the server process.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can cause the server to hang indefinitely, resulting in denial of service and preventing legitimate requests.
  remediation: |
    Update to the latest version beyond 19.2.1.
