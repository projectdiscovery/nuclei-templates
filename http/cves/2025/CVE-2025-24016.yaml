info:
  name: Wazuh - Unsafe Deserialization Remote Code Execution
  author: Hüseyin TINTAŞ,ritikchaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Wazuh server versions >= 4.4.0 and < 4.9.1. The vulnerability occurs due to unsafe deserialization in the wazuh-manager package, specifically in the DistributedAPI where parameters are serialized as JSON and deserialized using as_wazuh_object in the framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py file. An attacker with API access can exploit this vulnerability by injecting an unsanitized dictionary into DAPI requests, leading to arbitrary Python code execution.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Wazuh server with the privileges of the wazuh-manager process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, and potential denial of service conditions.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to Wazuh version >= 4.9.1 where this vulnerability has been patched. If immediate upgrade is not possible: Restrict API access to trusted IP addresses only, implement network segmentation to isolate Wazuh servers, monitor for suspicious API requests to the /security/user/authenticate/run_as endpoint, and consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.
