id: CVE-2025-6403

info:
  name: Code-Projects School Fees Payment System 1.0 - SQL Injection in /student.php (ID parameter)
  author: hnd3884
  severity: critical
  description: |
    SQL injection in School Fees Payment System 1.0 via the `ID` parameter in `/student.php` allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL and potentially achieve data disclosure or takeover.
  impact: |
    Remote attackers can inject SQL via the `ID` parameter to read, modify, or delete database content, potentially exposing sensitive student/payment data and enabling full application compromise depending on database privileges.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to a patched version if provided by the vendor, or apply input validation and parameterized queries / prepared statements for all database access in `/student.php` (ensure `ID` is validated as an integer or use bound parameters). If vendor patch not available, isolate the application and restrict public access until fixed.
