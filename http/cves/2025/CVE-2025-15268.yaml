id: CVE-2025-15268

info:
  name: WordPress Infility Global <= 2.14.46 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: bswearingen
  severity: high
  description: |
    The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection via the infility_get_data API action in all versions up to and including 2.14.46. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.
  remediation: |
    Update the Infility Global plugin to a version newer than 2.14.46.
