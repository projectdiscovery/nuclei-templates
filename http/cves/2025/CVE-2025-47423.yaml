info:
  name: Personal Weather Station Dashboard 12 - Directory Traversal
  author: pussycat0x
  severity: high
  description: |
    Personal Weather Station Dashboard 12_lts allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files via ../ directory traversal in the test parameter to /others/_test.php, as demonstrated by reading the server's private SSL key in cleartext.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files including private SSL keys through directory traversal in the test parameter, potentially exposing sensitive cryptographic material.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Personal Weather Station Dashboard to a version later than 12_lts that properly validates file paths.
