id: CVE-2025-69200

info:
  name: phpMyFAQ Unauthenticated Configuration Backup Disclosure
  author: Louay-075
  severity: high
  description: |
    phpMyFAQ versions <= 4.0.15 allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to
    trigger the configuration backup mechanism via POST /api/setup/backup.
    The generated ZIP archive is stored in a web-accessible location and
    contains sensitive configuration files including database credentials,
    leading to sensitive information disclosure.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows attackers to obtain database credentials
    and other sensitive configuration details, which can lead to database
    takeover or further compromise of the system.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to phpMyFAQ version 4.0.16 or later where this issue is fixed.
    Remove any publicly accessible backup ZIP files and restrict access
    to the API setup endpoints.
