info:
  name: LibreChat <= 0.7.9 - HTML Injection via Accept-Language Header
  author: Kazgangap
  severity: medium
  description: |
    A vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat version 0.7.9 and below allows for HTML injection via the Accept-Language header. 
    When a logged-in user sends an HTTP GET request with a crafted Accept-Language header, arbitrary HTML can be 
    injected into the <html lang=""> tag of the response. This can lead to potential security risks such as 
    cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or UI defacement.
  impact: |
    Injecting arbitrary HTML into the <html lang=""> tag can lead to XSS, session hijacking, 
    and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
  remediation: |
    Update LibreChat to the latest patched version. Implement strict input validation on the 
    Accept-Language header and ensure proper output encoding for the HTML lang attribute.
