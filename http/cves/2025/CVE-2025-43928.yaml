info:
  name: Infodraw MRS <= 7.1.0.0 - Unauthenticated Path Traversal
  author: ohmygod20260203
  severity: high
  description: |
    Infodraw Media Relay Service (MRS) version 7.1.0.0 and possibly earlier versions contain
    a path traversal vulnerability in the web server component (port 12654). The MRS web server
    allows login with any arbitrary username without proper authentication. The username field
    is used directly as a file path component, enabling directory traversal via ../ sequences.
    An attacker can read arbitrary files from the system, including ServerParameters.xml which
    contains administrator credentials in cleartext or MD5-hashed format. Both Linux and Windows
    deployments are affected. The software is used by law enforcement agencies worldwide for
    video surveillance, body cameras, and police drones.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files from the server, including configuration
    files containing admin credentials. This can lead to full system compromise, especially
    since MRS is used by law enforcement for surveillance operations.
  remediation: |
    Take the MRS application offline immediately and contact Infodraw for a security patch.
    Restrict network access to port 12654 using a VPN or IP allowlist. Conduct forensic
    investigation to determine if unauthorized access occurred.
