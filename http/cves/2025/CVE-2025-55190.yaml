id: CVE-2025-55190

info:
  name: ArgoCD Project API Token Repository Credentials Exposure
  author: nukunga[seunghyeonJeon]
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Argo CD API tokens with project-level permissions are able to retrieve sensitive repository credentials
    (usernames, passwords) through the project details API endpoint, even when the token only has standard
    application management permissions and no explicit access to secrets. This vulnerability affects versions
    v2.2.0-rc1 and later, including 2.13.0 through 2.13.8, 2.14.0 through 2.14.15, 3.0.0 through 3.0.12,
    and 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.1. Any token with project get permissions is vulnerable, including global permissions.
    Note: This template requires valid ArgoCD credentials (username/password) to test the vulnerability.
  impact: |
    Authenticated attackers with project-level API tokens can retrieve sensitive repository credentials including usernames and passwords without requiring explicit secret access permissions.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade ArgoCD to version 2.13.9, 2.14.16, 3.0.13, 3.1.2, or later depending on your version branch that properly restricts repository credential access.
