info:
  name: Landray EIS SQL注入漏洞 (CVE-2025-22214)
  author: Ark
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Landray EIS (Enterprise Information System) versions 2001 through 2006 contain a SQL injection vulnerability in the Message/fi_message_receiver.aspx endpoint. The replyid parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive database information, bypass authentication, or potentially achieve remote code execution through certain SQL Server configurations.
  remediation: |
    Update Landray EIS to the latest version that properly sanitizes user input in the replyid parameter. Implement parameterized queries and input validation throughout the application.
