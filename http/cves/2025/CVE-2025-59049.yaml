info:
  name: Mockoon < 9.2.0 - Path Traversal
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: high
  description: |
    Mockoon before 9.2.0 contains a path traversal and local file inclusion caused by unsafe templating of server filenames from user input, letting attackers read arbitrary files on the mock server filesystem, exploit requires crafted request.
  impact: |
    Attackers can read arbitrary files from the mock server filesystem through path traversal in static file serving, potentially exposing sensitive configuration and credential files.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Mockoon to version 9.2.0 or later that properly validates and restricts file paths in template processing.
