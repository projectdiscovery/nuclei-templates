info:
  name: Motors <= 5.6.67 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Password Update/Account Takeover
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The Motors theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.67. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user passwords, including those of administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can change arbitrary user passwords including administrators through insufficient identity validation, enabling complete site takeover and unauthorized access to all accounts.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Motors WordPress theme to version 5.6.68 or later that properly validates user identity before password changes.
