id: CVE-2025-26793

info:
  name: FREEDOM Administration - Default Login
  author: Eric Daigle,DhiyaneshDK
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH through 2024 ships with default credentials (username freedom, password viscount). The administrator is not prompted to change these credentials on initial configuration, and changing the credentials requires many steps. Attackers can use the credentials over the Internet via mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet to gain access to dozens of Canadian and U.S. apartment buildings and obtain building residents' PII. NOTE- the Supplier's perspective is that the "vulnerable systems are not following manufacturers' recommendations to change the default password."
  impact: |
    Attackers can gain unauthorized access to building management systems using default credentials, potentially exposing residents' personally identifiable information and controlling access to apartment buildings.
  remediation: |
    Change default credentials immediately to strong, unique passwords as recommended in the manufacturer's security guidelines.
