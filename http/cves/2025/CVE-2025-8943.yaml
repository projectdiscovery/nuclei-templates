id: CVE-2025-8943

info:
  name: Flowise - Remote Command Execution
  author: zezezez
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Flowise is vulnerable to remote command injection at the '/api/v1/node-load-method/customMCP' endpoint. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending a crafted JSON payload in a POST request to the customMCP endpoint.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands on the target server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, and lateral movement within the network.
  remediation: |
    Update Flowise to the latest version that addresses this vulnerability. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the customMCP endpoint parameters.
