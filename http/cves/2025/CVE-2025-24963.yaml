  name: Vitest Browser Mode - Local File Read
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Vitest is a testing framework powered by Vite. The `__screenshot-error` handler on the browser mode HTTP server that responds any file on the file system. Especially if the server is exposed on the network by `browser.api.host- true`, an attacker can send a request to that handler from remote to get the content of arbitrary files.This `__screenshot-error` handler on the browser mode HTTP server responds any file on the file system. This code was added by commit `2d62051`. Users explicitly exposing the browser mode server to the network by `browser.api.host- true` may get any files exposed. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.1.9 and 3.0.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
  impact: |
    Attackers can read arbitrary files from the file system when the browser mode server is exposed to the network, potentially exposing source code, configuration files, and sensitive credentials.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to Vitest version 2.1.9, 3.0.4 or later that addresses the __screenshot-error handler vulnerability.
