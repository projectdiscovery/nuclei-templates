id: CVE-2018-11759

info:
  name: Apache Tomcat JK Connect <=1.2.44 - Manager Access
  author: harshbothra_
  severity: high
  description: |
    Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44 allows specially constructed requests to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy. It is also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd. While there is some overlap between this issue and CVE-2018-1323, they are not identical.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Apache Tomcat Manager interface, potentially leading to further compromise of the server.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to a patched version of Apache Tomcat JK Connect (1.2.45 or higher) or apply the recommended security patches.
