id: CVE-2018-10561

info:
  name: Dasan GPON Router - Authentication Bypass
  author: MoltFire
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Dasan GPON home routers are vulnerable to authentication bypass. It is possible to bypass authentication simply by appending "?images/" to any URL of the device that requires authentication, as demonstrated by /menu.html?images/ or /GponForm/diag_Form?images/. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to access restricted pages and manage the device.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access restricted administrative pages and fully manage the device, potentially leading to further exploitation such as remote code execution.
  remediation: |
    Update the router firmware to the latest version or replace the device if no patch is available.
