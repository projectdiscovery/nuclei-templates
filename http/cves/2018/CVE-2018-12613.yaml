id: CVE-2018-12613

info:
  name: PhpMyAdmin <4.8.2 - Local File Inclusion
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: high
  description: PhpMyAdmin before version 4.8.2 is susceptible to local file inclusion that allows an attacker to include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade PhpMyAdmin to version 4.8.2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
