id: CVE-2018-9161

info:
  name: PrismaWEB - Credentials Disclosure
  author: gy741
  severity: critical
  description: PrismaWEB is susceptible to credential disclosure. The vulnerability exists due to the disclosure of hard-coded credentials allowing an attacker to effectively bypass authentication of PrismaWEB with administrator privileges. The credentials can be disclosed by simply navigating to the login_par.js JavaScript page that holds the username and password for the management interface that are being used via the Login() function in /scripts/functions_cookie.js script.
  impact: |
    An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially compromise user accounts and sensitive data.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that sensitive credentials are properly protected and not exposed in the application's source code or configuration files.
