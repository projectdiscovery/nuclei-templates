id: CVE-2023-27159

info:
  name: Appwrite <=1.2.1 - Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: DhiyaneshDk
  severity: high
  description: |
    Appwrite through 1.2.1 is susceptible to server-side request forgery via the component /v1/avatars/favicon. An attacker can potentially access network resources and sensitive information via a crafted GET request, thereby also making it possible to modify data and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.
  impact: |
    This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, potential data leakage, and further exploitation of the server.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Appwrite to a version higher than 1.2.1 to mitigate the SSRF vulnerability.
