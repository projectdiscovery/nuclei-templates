id: CVE-2023-0678

info:
  name: PHPIPAM <v1.5.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: princechaddha,ritikchaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    In phpIPAM 1.5.1, an unauthenticated user could download the list of high-usage IP subnets that contains sensitive information such as a subnet description, IP ranges, and usage rates via find_full_subnets.php endpoint. The bug lies in the fact that find_full_subnets.php does not verify if the user is authorized to access the data, and if the script was started from a command line.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive network information including IP subnet descriptions, ranges, and usage rates through the find_full_subnets.php endpoint without authorization.
  remediation: |
    Update phpIPAM to version 1.5.1 or later that implements proper authorization checks in find_full_subnets.php before returning subnet information.
