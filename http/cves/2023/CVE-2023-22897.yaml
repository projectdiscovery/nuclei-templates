info:
  name: Securepoint UTM - Leaking Remote Memory Contents
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in SecurePoint UTM before 12.2.5.1. The firewall's endpoint at /spcgi.cgi allows information disclosure of memory contents to be achieved by an authenticated user. Essentially, uninitialized data can be retrieved via an approach in which a sessionid is obtained but not used.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by Securepoint to fix the memory leakage issue.
