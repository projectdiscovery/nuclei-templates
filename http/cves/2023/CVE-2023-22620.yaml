  name: SecurePoint UTM 12.x Session ID Leak
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in SecurePoint UTM before 12.2.5.1. The firewall's endpoint at /spcgi.cgi allows sessionid information disclosure via an invalid authentication attempt. This can afterwards be used to bypass the device's authentication and get access to the administrative interface.
  remediation: Upgrade to version 12.2.5.1 or newer
