id: CVE-2023-6266

info:
  name: WordPress Backup Migration < 1.3.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download
  author: 0xanis
  severity: high
  description: |
    The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file download due to insufficient validation in the `handle_downloading` function. Attackers can retrieve the `latest.log` file to leak the names of sensitive backup files and subsequently download them.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can download full site backups, including database credentials (wp-config.php), user data, and other sensitive information, leading to full site compromise.
  remediation: |
    Update to Backup Migration plugin version 1.3.7 or later.
