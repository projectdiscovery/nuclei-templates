id: CVE-2019-10092

info:
  name: Apache HTTP Server <=2.4.39 -  HTML Injection/Partial Cross-Site Scripting
  author: pdteam
  severity: medium
  description: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.39 are vulnerable to a limited cross-site scripting issue affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.40 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
