id: CVE-2019-17662

info:
  name: ThinVNC 1.0b1 - Authentication Bypass
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: critical
  description: |
    ThinVNC 1.0b1 is vulnerable to arbitrary file read, which leads to a compromise of the VNC server. The vulnerability exists even when authentication is turned on during the deployment of the VNC server. The password for authentication is stored in cleartext in a file that can be read via a ../../ThinVnc.ini directory traversal attack vector.
  impact: |
    An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the ThinVNC application.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to a patched version of ThinVNC or implement additional authentication mechanisms.
