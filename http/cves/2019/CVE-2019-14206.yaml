id: CVE-2019-14206

info:
  name: Nevma Adaptive Images < 0.6.67 - Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: KrE80r
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Nevma Adaptive Images plugin before 0.6.67 for WordPress allows unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion via unsanitized 'adaptive-images-settings' array parameters. The plugin accepts user-controlled source_file, wp_content, cache_dir, and request_uri values without validation, enabling path traversal to delete arbitrary files.

    Deletion requires source_file timestamp > target timestamp. Attackers use recently uploaded media or modified files (like .htaccess) as source_file.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing denial of service by removing critical files like wp-config.php.
  remediation: Update to version 0.6.67 or later, or remove the plugin.
