id: CVE-2021-36749

info:
  name: Apache Druid - Local File Inclusion
  author: _0xf4n9x_
  severity: medium
  description: Apache Druid ingestion system is vulnerable to local file inclusion. The InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the affected system.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by Apache Druid to fix the LFI vulnerability.
