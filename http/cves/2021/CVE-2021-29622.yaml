id: CVE-2021-29622

info:
  name: Prometheus  - Open Redirect
  author: geeknik
  severity: medium
  description: Prometheus 2.23.0 through 2.26.0 and 2.27.0 contains an open redirect vulnerability. To ensure a seamless transition to 2.27.0, the default UI was changed to the new UI with a URL prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, an attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site and possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites, leading to potential phishing attacks or the disclosure of sensitive information.
  remediation: The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.
