id: CVE-2021-28149

info:
  name: Hongdian H8922 3.0.5 Devices - Local File Inclusion
  author: gy741
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Hongdian H8922 3.0.5 devices are vulnerable to local file inclusion. The /log_download.cgi log export handler does not validate user input and allows a remote attacker with minimal privileges to download any file from the device by substituting ../ (e.g., ../../etc/passwd) This can be carried out with a web browser by changing the file name accordingly. Upon visiting log_download.cgi?type=../../etc/passwd and logging in, the web server will allow a download of the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by the vendor to fix the LFI vulnerability in Hongdian H8922 3.0.5 Devices.
