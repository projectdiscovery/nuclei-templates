  description: |
    The Kaswara Modern VC Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient capability checking on various AJAX actions.

  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can perform unauthorized actions including file uploads, deletions, and data import, potentially leading to site compromise.
  remediation: |
    Deactivate and delete the plugin from the server
