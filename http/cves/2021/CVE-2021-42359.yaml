id: CVE-2021-42359

info:
  name: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: daffainfo
  severity: high
  description: |
    WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, ‘admin-dismiss-unsubscribe‘, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the “action” parameter set to “admin-dismiss-unsubscribe” and the “id” parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can permanently delete arbitrary WordPress posts and pages by exploiting the unprotected admin-dismiss-unsubscribe AJAX action.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to WP DSGVO Tools version 3.1.24 or later.
