id: CVE-2020-35951

info:
  name: Wordpress Quiz and Survey Master <7.0.1 - Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: Wordpress Quiz and Survey Master <7.0.1 allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to the latest version of Wordpress Quiz and Survey Master plugin (7.0.1 or higher) to mitigate this vulnerability.
