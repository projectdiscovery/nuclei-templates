info:
  name: IBM Data Risk Manager - Authentication Bypass via SAML
  author: ritikchaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    IBM Data Risk Manager versions 2.0.1 through 2.0.6 are vulnerable to authentication bypass when configured with SAML authentication. A remote attacker can bypass security restrictions by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the SAML idpSelection endpoint, allowing them to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication via SAML endpoint and gain full administrative access to IBM Data Risk Manager, compromising all managed data risk information.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security updates and patches provided by Cisco for HyperFlex HX.
