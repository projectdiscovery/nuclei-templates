id: CVE-2020-35580

info:
  name: SearchBlox <9.2.2 - Local File Inclusion
  author: daffainfo
  severity: high
  description: SearchBlox prior to version 9.2.2 is susceptible to local file inclusion in  FileServlet that allows remote, unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from the operating system via a /searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=url= request. Additionally, this may be used to read the contents of the SearchBlox configuration file (e.g., searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml), which contains both the Super Admin API key and the base64 encoded SHA1 password hashes of other SearchBlox users.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data stored on the server.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to SearchBlox version 9.2.2 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
