id: CVE-2020-3580

info:
  name: Cisco ASA/FTD Software - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct attacks against a user of the web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the reference links.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a targeted user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by Cisco to mitigate this vulnerability.
