id: CVE-2020-36836

info:
  name: WordPress WP Fastest Cache <= 0.9.0.2 - Broken Access Control
  author: rajanarahul93
  severity: high
  description: |
    The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress through 0.9.0.2 is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing capability check on the 'wpfc_delete_current_page_cache' AJAX action. Any authenticated user, regardless of their role (e.g., Subscriber), can call this action and use a path traversal payload to delete arbitrary files on the filesystem. This template safely checks for the vulnerability by sending a request to delete a non-existent file and matching the success response.
