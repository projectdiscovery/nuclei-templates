  name: TileServer GL <=3.0.0 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: Akash.C
  severity: medium
  description: TileServer GL through 3.0.0 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via server.js  because the content of the key GET parameter is reflected unsanitized in an HTTP response for the application's main page.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade TileServer GL to a version higher than 3.0.0 or apply the vendor-provided patch to fix the XSS vulnerability.
