  name: Deprecated Feature-Policy Header - Detection
  author: ritikchaddha
  severity: info
  description: |
    Detected the presence of the deprecated Feature-Policy HTTP response header. The Feature-Policy header has been deprecated and replaced by the Permissions-Policy header. While Feature-Policy is still supported in some browsers for backward compatibility, it is recommended to migrate to Permissions-Policy for future-proofing web applications.
