  name: Azure API Management Service Resource Logs Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Azure API Management API services are configured to use resource logs to collect valuable information on API Management operations and errors. By enabling resource logs through a diagnostic setting, you can gather extensive information on the API requests received and handled by the Azure API Management service gateway.
  impact: |
    Failing to configure resource logs for Azure API Management services could result in a lack of visibility into API performance and errors, hindering effective management and troubleshooting.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that resource logs are enabled by setting up diagnostic settings for each Azure API Management service instance. This should include capturing all logs related to API operations and errors.
