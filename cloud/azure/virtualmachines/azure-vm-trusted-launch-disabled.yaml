  description: |
    Ensure that the Trusted Launch security feature is enabled for Gen 2 virtual machines (VMs) in order to protect against persistent and advanced attacks with configurable capabilities such as Secure Boot and virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM).
  impact: |
    Not enabling Trusted Launch for virtual machines can leave them susceptible to advanced persistent threats and compromise the integrity and security of your virtual environment.
  remediation: |
    Enable the Trusted Launch feature on your Azure VMs to utilize security enhancements such as Secure Boot and vTPM to protect against sophisticated attacks.
