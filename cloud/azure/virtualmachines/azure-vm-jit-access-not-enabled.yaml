  name: Azure VM Just-In-Time Access Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that Just-in-Time (JIT) access is enabled for your Azure virtual machines (VMs) in order to allow you to lock down inbound traffic to your VMs and reduce exposure to attacks while providing easy SSH/RDP access when needed.
  impact: |
    Not having JIT access enabled on Azure VMs can lead to increased exposure to attacks due to unrestricted inbound traffic.
  remediation: |
    Enable Just-in-Time access for your Azure VMs to control inbound traffic and improve security.
