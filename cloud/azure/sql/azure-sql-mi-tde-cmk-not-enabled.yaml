  name: Azure SQL MI TDE Not Using Customer-Managed Keys
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) is enabled for your Microsoft Azure SQL managed instances. The TDE protector configured for your Azure SQL managed instances must be encrypted with a Customer-Managed Key in order to protect your managed SQL databases with a key from your own Azure key vault. This enables you to have full control over the encryption and decryption process and meet strict compliance requirements.
  impact: |
    Not using Customer-Managed Keys for Transparent Data Encryption can compromise data security by relying on less controlled service-managed keys and potentially fail to meet compliance requirements.
  remediation: |
    Configure Transparent Data Encryption to use Customer-Managed Keys by setting the TDE protector to use a key from your Azure key vault for your SQL managed instances.
