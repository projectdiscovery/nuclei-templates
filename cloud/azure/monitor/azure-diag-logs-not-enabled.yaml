  name: Diagnostic Logs Not Enabled for Azure Resources
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that Diagnostic Logs are enabled for all the supported Azure resources to log interactions within your cloud resources. Logging every access request and operation to your cloud resources is a security best practice.
  impact: |
    Failure to enable Diagnostic Logs can lead to a lack of insight into operations performed within resources, such as Azure Key Vault, which could potentially hinder the ability to perform security and compliance auditing.
  remediation: |
    Enable Diagnostic Logs for all Azure resources and ensure logs are sent to a storage account and Log Analytics Workspace or an equivalent system. Logs should be kept in accessible storage for at least one year, then moved to cold storage.
