  name: Azure Virtual Machine Deallocate Alert Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is fired whenever "Deallocate Virtual Machine" events are triggered within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. An Azure activity log alert is triggered when a new activity log event that matches the condition specified in the alert configuration occurs. For this conformity rule, the matched condition is `Whenever the Administrative Activity Log "Deallocate Virtual Machine (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines)" has "any" Event level, with "any" Status and Event initiated by "any"`.
  impact: |
    Without an alert for "Deallocate Virtual Machine" events, unauthorized or unintended shutdowns of VMs may occur without detection, leading to potential disruptions and security risks.
  remediation: |
    Configure Azure activity log alerts to detect "Deallocate Virtual Machine" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action" and ensuring that alerts trigger notifications appropriately.
