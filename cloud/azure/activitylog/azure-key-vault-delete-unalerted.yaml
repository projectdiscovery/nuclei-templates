  name: Azure Key Vault Delete Alert Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that a Microsoft Azure activity log alert is fired whenever a "Delete Key Vault" event is triggered inside your Azure cloud account. An activity log alert fires each time the action event that matches the condition specified in the alert configuration is triggered. The alert condition that this conformity rule checks for is "Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category='Administrative', Signal name='Delete Key Vault (vaults)'".
  impact: |
    Without monitoring for "Delete Key Vault" events, unauthorized or unwanted deletions of key vaults might go unnoticed, leading to potential security and compliance risks.
  remediation: |
    Configure alert rules to monitor and notify whenever "Delete Key Vault" events occur by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/delete" and attaching an action group to manage notifications.
