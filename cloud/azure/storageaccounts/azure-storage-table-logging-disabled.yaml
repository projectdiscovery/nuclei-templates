  name: Azure Storage Table Logging Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that Azure Storage Table service logging is enabled for read, write, and delete requests. The Azure Storage Table service stores structured NoSQL data in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schema-less design. Storage logging is performed server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in the associated storage account.
  impact: |
    Failing to enable logging for the Azure Storage Table service can prevent tracking of successful and failed requests, impacting auditing and troubleshooting capabilities.
  remediation: |
    Enable logging for read, write, and delete requests in the Azure Storage Table service through the Azure portal or using the Azure CLI.
