  name: Key Vault Recoverability Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that production Azure Key Vaults are recoverable to prevent permanent deletion/purging of encryption keys, secrets, and certificates stored within these vaults. To make your Azure Key Vault instances recoverable, you need to enable both "Soft Delete" and "Do Not Purge" features. "Soft Delete" ensures recoverability for 90 days post-deletion, whereas "Do Not Purge" prevents any purging of the vault and its contents.
  impact: |
    Failure to configure recoverability settings can lead to irreversible loss of critical data stored in Azure Key Vaults due to permanent deletion.
  remediation: |
    Enable "Soft Delete" and "Do Not Purge" on all Azure Key Vaults to ensure they are recoverable and protected against permanent deletion.
