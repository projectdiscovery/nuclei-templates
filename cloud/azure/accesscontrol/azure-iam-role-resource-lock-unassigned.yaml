  name: Azure IAM Role for Resource Locking Not Assigned
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure there is a custom IAM role assigned to manage resource locking within each Microsoft Azure subscription. Azure resource locking is a powerful protection mechanism that can prevent inadvertent modification or deletion of resources. This role should have specific permissions to read, write, and delete resource locks.
  impact: |
    Failure to assign a custom IAM role for resource locking can lead to unauthorized changes or deletions of Azure resources, increasing the risk of service disruption and non-compliance with security best practices.
  remediation: |
    Create a custom IAM role with permissions for Microsoft.Authorization/locks/read, Microsoft.Authorization/locks/write, and Microsoft.Authorization/locks/delete and ensure it is assigned to an identity.
