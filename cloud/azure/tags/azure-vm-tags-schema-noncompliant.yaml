  name: Azure VM Tags Schema Non-compliant
  author: princechaddha
  severity: low
  description: |
    Ensure that user-defined tags are being used for labeling, collecting, and organizing cloud resources within your Microsoft Azure account. User-defined tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple cloud resources. Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Conformity recommends the following tagging schema to help you identify and manage your Azure resources: Name, Role, Environment, and Owner.
  impact: |
    Not using the recommended tagging schema can lead to difficulties in managing and organizing cloud resources effectively, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs.
  remediation: |
    Update the tagging schema of your Azure virtual machines to include the recommended tags: Name, Role, Environment, and Owner to ensure effective resource management and billing.
