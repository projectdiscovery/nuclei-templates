  name: RAM Password Policy Reuse - Enabled
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Alibaba Cloud RAM (Resource Access Management) password policy reuse is disabled, meaning users are not restricted from reusing old passwords. This lack of a configured password history policy increases the risk of users reusing weak, previously compromised, or easily guessable passwords, which could lead to unauthorized access.
