  name: DMS Multi-AZ Not Enabled
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS) replication instances are using Multi-AZ deployment configurations to provide High Availability (HA) through automatic failover to standby replicas in the event of a failure such as an Availability Zone (AZ) outage, an internal hardware or network outage, a software failure or in case of a planned maintenance session
  impact: |
    Not enabling Multi-AZ for Database Migration Service can lead to increased downtime and data loss risks during outages, compromising the availability and reliability of your database operations.
  remediation: |
    Enable Multi-AZ support for your Database Migration Service to enhance availability and resilience, ensuring automatic failover and reducing downtime during outages.
