  name: Enable Usage and Storage Logs for Cloud Storage Buckets
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that usage and storage logs are enabled for your Google Cloud Storage buckets to monitor activity, track costs, detect suspicious behavior, and ensure compliance with security and audit requirements.
  impact: |
    Without usage and storage logs, it is challenging to monitor access patterns, detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with organizational policies and security standards.
  remediation: |
    Enable usage and storage logs for your Google Cloud Storage buckets to gain visibility into bucket activity and ensure audit compliance.
