info:
  name: Enable Uniform Bucket-Level Access for Cloud Storage Buckets
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that uniform bucket-level access is enabled for all your Google Cloud Storage buckets. This ensures that object access is controlled entirely through bucket-level IAM permissions, providing a consistent and secure way to manage access to bucket data.
  impact: |
    Without uniform bucket-level access, managing object-level permissions can lead to inconsistent and insecure access control configurations.
  remediation: |
    Enable uniform bucket-level access for your Google Cloud Storage buckets to manage permissions uniformly and improve security.
