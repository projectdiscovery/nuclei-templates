  name: Check Bucket Policies with Administrative Permissions
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that the IAM policy associated with your Google Cloud Storage buckets does not grant privileged, administrative permissions. This promotes the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) by providing principals only the minimal access required to perform their tasks.
  impact: |
    Administrative permissions on Cloud Storage buckets can lead to unauthorized changes, data exposure, or potential misuse, violating security best practices.
  remediation: |
    Review and update IAM policies for your Google Cloud Storage buckets to remove roles such as roles/owner, roles/editor, or any roles containing "Admin" to adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege.
