  name: Enable Object Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys for Cloud Storage Buckets
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Storage data is encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) to maintain full control over your data encryption and decryption processes. CMKs can be managed with the Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
  impact: |
    Without CMK encryption, you lose the ability to manage key rotation, encryption policies, and data access, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access.
  remediation: |
    Configure your Cloud Storage buckets to use Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption to enhance data security and comply with organizational policies.
