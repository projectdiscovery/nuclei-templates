  name: Export All Log Entries Using Sinks Not Configured
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure there is at least one sink used to export copies of all the log entries available within your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. A sink is an object created to hold a log query and a destination. You can export logs by creating one or more log sinks that include a log query and an export destination. As Google Cloud Logging service receives new log entries, they are compared against each sink. If a log entry matches a sink object query, then a copy of the log entry is written to the sink's export destination.
  impact: |
    If no sinks are configured to export all log entries, critical log data might be lost or inaccessible for analysis, leading to potential security risks and compliance violations.
  remediation: |
    Create a log sink with a blank filter to export all log entries within the project. Ensure the export destination aligns with your organizational logging strategy.
