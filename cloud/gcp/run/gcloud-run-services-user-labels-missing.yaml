  name: Missing User-Defined Labels in Cloud Run Services
  author: princechaddha
  severity: low
  description: |
    Ensure that user-defined labels are being used to tag, collect, and organize Cloud Run services within your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects. User-defined labels are a lightweight and efficient way to group together related or associated cloud resources.
  impact: |
    Not using user-defined labels for Cloud Run services can lead to difficulties in managing, organizing, and categorizing resources, especially in large-scale environments.
  remediation: |
    Add user-defined labels to Cloud Run services to improve resource management. Ensure that the labels are meaningful and adhere to organizational standards for resource grouping.
