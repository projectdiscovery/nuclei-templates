  name: Publicly Accessible Google Cloud KMS Keys
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that the IAM policy associated with your Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) keys restricts anonymous and/or public access. The KMS cryptographic keys are controlled by Cloud IAM policies, which should not include bindings for "allUsers" and "allAuthenticatedUsers" to prevent public internet access.
  impact: |
    If a KMS key is accessible to "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers", it means any internet user can access this cryptographic resource, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  remediation: |
    Update the IAM policy for your KMS keys by removing any bindings that include "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" to restrict access to authenticated and authorized users only.
