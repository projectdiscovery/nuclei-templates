  name: Automatic Upgrades Not Enabled for Vertex AI Notebooks
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that automatic upgrades for Vertex AI Workbench notebook instances are enabled to get the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates without manual intervention. Once auto-upgrades are enabled, Vertex AI Workbench will check, during a recurring time period that you specify, whether your notebook instances can be upgraded, and if so, the service will upgrade your instances.
  impact: |
    Without automatic upgrades enabled, notebook instances may miss critical security updates, performance improvements, and new features. Manual upgrades require additional operational overhead and can lead to inconsistent environments.
  remediation: |
    Enable automatic upgrades for Vertex AI notebook instances using the 'gcloud workbench instances update' command with metadata parameter 'notebook-upgrade-schedule'. Example: --metadata 'notebook-upgrade-schedule=3 12 * * SUN' for weekly Sunday upgrades.
