  name: Enable Logging for VPC Firewall Rules
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Enable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rule logging for each firewall rule whose connections you need to log. Firewall rule logging provides valuable insights into the source and destination of traffic, protocols, ports, and actions taken by the rules.
  impact: |
    Without firewall rule logging, it is difficult to analyze and monitor network traffic, making it challenging to troubleshoot and ensure compliance with security policies.
  remediation: |
    Enable logging for your VPC firewall rules to capture connection details, including traffic source, destination, and actions taken by the rules.
