  name: Artifact Registry Vulnerability Scanning Not Enabled
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that vulnerability scanning for Google Cloud Artifact Registry repositories is enabled in order to find security weaknesses in your container images before deploying them and help prevent security breaches.
  impact: |
    Disabling vulnerability scanning on Artifact Registry repositories can expose your deployment to undiscovered security vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of security breaches.
  remediation: |
    Enable the Container Scanning API for each Artifact Registry by visiting the API & services page in the Google Cloud Console and enabling `containerscanning.googleapis.com`.
