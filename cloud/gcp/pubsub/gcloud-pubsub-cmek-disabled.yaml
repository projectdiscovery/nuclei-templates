  name: Pub/Sub Topics Not Encrypted with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics are encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEKs) to have full control over the data encryption and decryption process. Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEKs) allow you to create and manage your own encryption keys with Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
  impact: |
    Not using CMEKs for Pub/Sub topics can result in less control over data encryption and potential exposure to unauthorized access.
  remediation: |
    Configure your Pub/Sub topics to use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEKs) by specifying a Cloud KMS key during the topic creation or update process.
