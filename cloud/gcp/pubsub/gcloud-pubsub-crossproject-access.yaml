  name: Pub/Sub Subscription Cross-Project Access
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions are configured to allow access only to trusted GCP projects to protect against unauthorized cross-project access. The list with the trusted GCP projects must be defined in the conformity rule settings, in the Trend Cloud One™ – Conformity account console.
  impact: |
    Allowing access to Pub/Sub subscriptions from untrusted GCP projects can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and potential data exfiltration.
  remediation: |
    Restrict access to Pub/Sub subscriptions by configuring IAM policies to include only trusted service accounts or users. Ensure roles such as "roles/pubsub.subscriber", "roles/pubsub.editor", or "roles/pubsub.admin" are only assigned to trusted principals.
