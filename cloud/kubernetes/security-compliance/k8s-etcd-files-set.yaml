  name: Ensure etcd cert and key set
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: Checks if the etcd-certfile and etcd-keyfile arguments are properly set in the etcd server configuration, crucial for secure communication.
  impact: |
    If the etcd-certfile and etcd-keyfile arguments are not set, the etcd server might not encrypt its communications, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  remediation: |
    Configure the etcd server to use etcd-certfile and etcd-keyfile arguments that point to valid certificate and key files respectively. This ensures that communications to and from the etcd server are properly encrypted.
