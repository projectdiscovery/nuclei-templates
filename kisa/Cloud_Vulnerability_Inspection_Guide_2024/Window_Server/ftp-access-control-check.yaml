  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure FTP access is restricted by configuring IP address filters. Without these restrictions, unauthorized networks could potentially access FTP services.
  impact: |
    Lack of proper IP-based access control allows FTP services to be accessed by unauthorized networks, heightening the risk of data breaches and other security threats.
  remediation: |
    Set up IP address restrictions using IIS Manager:
    - Open IIS Manager.
    - Go to the FTP site → FTP IP Address and Domain Restrictions.
    - Add the allowed IP addresses and configure suitable deny rules.
