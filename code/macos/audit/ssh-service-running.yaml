    Checks if the SSH service (Remote Login) is running on the macOS system.
  impact: |
    While not a vulnerability in itself, a running SSH service can be a potential attack vector if not properly configured and secured.
  remediation: |
    Disable the SSH service if it is not needed. If it is required, ensure that it is properly configured with strong passwords and key-based authentication.
