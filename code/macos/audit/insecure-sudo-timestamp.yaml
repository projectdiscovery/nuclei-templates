  name: macOS Excessive Sudo Timestamp Timeout
  author: geeknik
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Checks if the sudo timestamp timeout is configured to an excessively long duration (100+ minutes).
  impact: |
    A long sudo timestamp can allow a user to execute commands with root privileges for an extended period of time without re-entering their password.
  remediation: |
    Set the sudo timestamp to a reasonable value to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
