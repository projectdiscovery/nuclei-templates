  name: macOS Permissive Umask Configuration
  author: geeknik
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Verifies if the umask is configured with overly permissive values that create insecurely accessible files.
  impact: |
    A permissive umask can result in new files being created with world-writable permissions, which can be a security risk.
  remediation: |
    Set the umask to a more restrictive value to ensure that new files are created with secure permissions.
