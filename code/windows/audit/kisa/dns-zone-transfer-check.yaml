  name: DNS Zone Transfer Check
  author: nukunga[SungHyunJeon]
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure DNS zone transfers are restricted by verifying that the SecureSecondaries registry value is set to 2 for all active zones.
    Unrestricted zone transfers can expose sensitive domain information, helping attackers map the network infrastructure.
  impact: |
    If DNS zone transfers are not properly restricted, attackers could access domain and zone details, which may aid in planning and launching further attacks against the network infrastructure.
  remediation: |
    Configure DNS zone transfer restrictions by:
    - Disabling zone transfers entirely, or
    - Restricting transfers to designated servers by setting the SecureSecondaries registry value to 2.
