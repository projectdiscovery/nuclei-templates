  name: Remote Desktop Listening Default Port - Detect
  author: asteria121
  severity: info
  description: |
    The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service listens on a default port (TCP 3389), which is commonly targeted by attackers.
  impact: |
    Exposure of the default RDP port (TCP 3389) increases the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access. This can lead to system compromise, data breaches, and ransomware deployment.
  remediation: |
    Change the default RDP listening port to a non-standard port to reduce exposure.
