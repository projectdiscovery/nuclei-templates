  description: |
    The dnsmasq package provides lightweight DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services. If not explicitly required, its presence may expose unnecessary services and increase security risks.
  remediation: |
    - Ensure the `dnsmasq` package is not installed unless explicitly required.
    - To remove the package, run: sudo apt-get remove dnsmasq -y
