  name: Ensure LDAP Server Service is Not Installed
  author: Th3l0newolf
  severity: info
  description: |
    The slapd package provides the OpenLDAP server, which manages directory and identity services. If not explicitly required, having this service installed unnecessarily increases the system’s attack surface.
  remediation: |
    - Run: sudo apt-get remove slapd -y
    - This removes the LDAP server package to reduce the system’s attack surface.
