  name: Ensure NIS Client is Not Installed
  author: Th3l0newolf
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The NIS (Network Information Service) client package should not be installed on the system, as it is considered insecure and deprecated. Removing it helps reduce the system's attack surface.
  remediation: |
    Run 'sudo apt-get remove nis -y' to uninstall the NIS client package.
