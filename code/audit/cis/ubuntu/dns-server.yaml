    The bind9 package provides a DNS server for name resolution services.Running a DNS server on systems not designated for that purpose may expose them to unnecessary risks.
  remediation: |
    - Ensure the `bind9` package is not installed unless explicitly required.
    - To remove the package, run: sudo apt-get remove bind9 -y
