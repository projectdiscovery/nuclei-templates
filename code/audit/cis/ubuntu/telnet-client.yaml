  name: Ensure Telnet Client is Not Installed
  author: Th3l0newolf
  severity: info
  description: |
    The telnet and inetutils-telnet packages provide a Telnet client for remote access.Since Telnet uses unencrypted communication, these packages should not be installed to reduce the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access.
  remediation: |
    Ensure telnet and inetutils-telnet packages are not installed unless explicitly required.To remove them, run: sudo apt-get remove telnet inetutils-telnet -y
