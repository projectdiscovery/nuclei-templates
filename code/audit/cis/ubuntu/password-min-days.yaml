  name: Ensure Minimum Password Days is Configured
  author: Th3l0newolf
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The PASS_MIN_DAYS setting in /etc/login.defs defines the minimum number of days required between password changes.This prevents users from rapidly cycling through passwords to bypass password history requirements.
  remediation: |
    Edit /etc/login.defs and ensure the line is set to: PASS_MIN_DAYS 1 (or another value greater than 0).Verify the change with: grep -Pi -- '^\h*PASS_MIN_DAYS\h+\d+\b' /etc/login.defs
