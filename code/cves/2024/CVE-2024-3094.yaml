id: CVE-2024-3094

info:
  name: XZ - Embedded Malicious Code
  author: pdteam
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.
  remediation: |
    Downgrade XZ Utils to version 5.4.x or earlier that does not contain the malicious backdoor code.
  impact: |
    Attackers can intercept and modify data processed by liblzma, leading to data tampering and potential data integrity breaches.
