  name: WinRAR Path Traversal Vulnerability
  author: Jules
  severity: high
  description: |
    WinRAR for Windows contains a path traversal vulnerability that can be exploited using crafted malicious archive files.
    This allows attackers to write files to arbitrary locations on the victim's system, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    The vulnerability is exploited by including path traversal sequences (e.g., `../` or `..\`) in the filename fields within the RAR archive's headers.
