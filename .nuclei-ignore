# ==| Nuclei Templates Ignore list |==
# ====================================
#
# This list can be used to define template/s that will be blocked from execution.
# When a folder/directory is listed under this list, the templates within folder can be executed only when running them directly.
# For example, "nuclei -t fuzzing" will not work, "nuclei -t fuzzing/wp-plugin-scan.yaml" will be executed.
# 
# Why ignore list? - To ensure nuclei is not getting used to hammer the every web server with templates that are meant to be used for specific use cases. 
# and that doesn't mean nuclei won't let you run these templates. if you know what you are doing, feel free to updates this list locally as per your need.
#
# This list also can be used to ignore templates that you wanted to exclude from every scan.
