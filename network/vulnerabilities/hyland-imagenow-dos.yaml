  name: Hyland Perceptive Content Server / ImageNow - Denial of Service (CVE-2018-19629)
  author: copilot
  severity: high
  description: |
    Hyland Perceptive Content Server (ImageNow) <= 7.1.4 contains a denial of
    service that can be triggered via a specially crafted TCP packet against the
    ImageNow Server service. This template includes non-intrusive fingerprint
    probes and an optional intrusive proof-of-concept payload (do not run
    against third-party systems).

# Non-intrusive fingerprint: try to get an HTTP response if ImageNow serves
# web UI on typical ports, or read any TCP banner. This step avoids sending the
# destructive payload and should be run by default.

  - # Intrusive proof-of-concept (DoS). This will send the crash trigger observed in
    # public research. DO NOT RUN AGAINST THIRD-PARTIES. This block is intentionally
    # labelled and should only be executed by operators who understand the impact.

# Guidance for triage: include -debug output when reporting
description: |
  Notes:
  - The crash trigger was reported in public research and mapped to TCP port 6000.
  - The intrusive PoC payload is present in this template; do NOT run it against
    third-party targets. To help triage, run nuclei with `-debug` and attach the
    debug output showing the TCP interaction (connect, send bytes, resets).
