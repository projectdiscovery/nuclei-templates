  description: |
    The SSH key exchange algorithm is fundamental to keep the protocol secure. It is what allows two previously unknown parties to generate a shared key in plain sight, and have that secret remain private to the client and server. Over time, some implementations of this algorithm have been identified as weak or vulnerable.
