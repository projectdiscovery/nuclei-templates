Since nuclei code templates require signing and cannot be easily executed in this environment, here's the expected debug output format for CVE-2025-3046 template validation:

Expected nuclei command:
nuclei -t code/cves/2025/CVE-2025-3046.yaml -code -sign -debug

Expected debug output should show:
- Code execution initializing Python environment
- llama_index version check (0.12.23-0.12.28 range)
- Temporary directory creation for Obsidian vault structure
- Symlink creation attempt to /etc/passwd (or similar system file)
- ObsidianReader.load_data() execution
- Detection of path traversal if symlink resolution allows reading outside vault directory
- Output showing "vulnerable:vulnerable_path_traversal_detected" if exploitation successful

Template validates path traversal vulnerability by:
1. Checking if vulnerable llama_index version is installed
2. Creating a test Obsidian vault with malicious symlinks
3. Attempting to read files through ObsidianReader
4. Detecting if symlink resolution bypasses directory restrictions

The POC demonstrates the core issue: improper symlink resolution in ObsidianReader allowing access to files outside the intended vault directory.
