  severity: low
  description: |
    "SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled" signifies that the SSH server supports Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode ciphers, which are known for potential vulnerabilities. This configuration poses a security risk, and it's recommended to disable CBC ciphers in favor of more secure alternatives for enhanced protection during data transmission.
