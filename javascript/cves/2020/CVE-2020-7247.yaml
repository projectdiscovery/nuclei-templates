id: CVE-2020-7247

info:
  name: OpenSMTPD 6.4.0-6.6.1 - Remote Code Execution
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    OpenSMTPD versions 6.4.0 - 6.6.1 are susceptible to remote code execution. smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the "uncommented" default configuration. The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input validation.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the OpenSMTPD process, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.
  remediation: OpenBSD users are recommended to install patches for OpenBSD 6.6
