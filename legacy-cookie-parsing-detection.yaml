  name: Legacy Cookie Parsing Detection
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects web servers or frameworks that support or rely on legacy cookie parsing
    standards (e.g., RFC2109 and RFC6265), which may default to legacy parsing
    logic if the cookie header contains the $Version attribute. This test specifically
    checks for legacy cookie parsing behavior, which can be exploited by attackers
    for various purposes.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that your web server or framework is configured to follow the latest
    cookie parsing standards (RFC6265) and does not fall back to legacy parsing
    logic. This may involve updating configurations or applying patches from the
    vendor to adhere to RFC6265 standards.
