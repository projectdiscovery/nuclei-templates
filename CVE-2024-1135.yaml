id: CVE-2024-1135

info:
  name: Gunicorn - HTTP Request Smuggling
  author: ManieshNeupane (Pwn4arn)
  severity: high
  description: |
    Gunicorn is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper validation of the Transfer-Encoding header. 
    If a request contains both Content-Length and a malformed or multiple Transfer-Encoding headers, Gunicorn 
    may fall back to Content-Length. An attacker can exploit this to bypass security controls, poison caches, 
    or manipulate session data.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to administrative endpoints or sensitive data 
    by smuggling a secondary request that the server processes as a separate, legitimate request.
  remediation: |
    Update Gunicorn to a version that properly handles Transfer-Encoding headers or ensure the frontend 
    proxy strictly validates these headers.
