  name: Worst Fit RCE
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: |
    This template detects command injection vulnerabilities via the use of fullwidth characters in Windows environments. The vulnerability arises due to the "Best Fit" mapping in Windows, which can convert certain UTF-16 characters to similar-looking ANSI characters. This allows for the injection of shell commands, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  remediation: |
    To mitigate this issue, ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before being passed to any command execution functions. Avoid using functions that automatically interpret user input as command-line arguments, and consider using more secure alternatives that do not rely on shell interpretation. Additionally, implement a strict allowlist for acceptable inputs and consider using execution environments that do not suffer from character encoding issues.
